* fixing imports on microphone sensor
* excluded sonar module
* excluded camera as a python module
* Added support for configuring ip and port of parent broker
  This commit adds support to the nao camera nodelet to get the
  ip and port settings from ros parameters. That way the nodelet
  can be configured using launchfiles or using command line parameters via ros.
* Remove old member and add comment
* Replace volatile bool with boost::mutex
  Volatile bool is not sufficient to prevent poll() and reconfigure() from
  executing concurrently. This causes the nodelet to crash when poll()
  releases the image on a closed camera.
  Here a mutex is introduced to guard the relevant critical sections.
